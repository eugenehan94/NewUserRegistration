# NewUserRegistration

## Program Walkthrough
This program has two options to choose from. The user would either select to register or view existing user(s). Selecting to register, it will ask users to enter 
their first name, last name, gender, phone number and email address, which will be saved in the mySQL database. If the input don't fulfill the criterias, red text would appear
and inform the user. By selecting to view existing users, it will show all registered users in a list with an assigned ID number. The user may also edit the existing users 
and delete them as well.
